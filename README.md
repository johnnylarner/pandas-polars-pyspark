# ppp

This project contains the code for the pandas-polars-pyspark (PPP) experiment.

## Getting Started

To set up your local development environment, please run:

    poetry install

Behind the scenes, this creates a virtual environment and installs `ppp` along with its dependencies into a new virtualenv. Whenever you run `poetry run <command>`, that `<command>` is actually run inside the virtualenv managed by poetry.

You can now import functions and classes from the module with `import ppp`.

### Testing

We use `pytest` as test framework. To execute the tests, please run

    pytest tests

To run the tests with coverage information, please use

    pytest tests --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

and have a look at the `htmlcov` folder, after the tests are done.

### Distribution Package

To build a distribution package (wheel), please use

    python setup.py bdist_wheel

this will clean up the build folder and then run the `bdist_wheel` command.

### Contributions

Before contributing, please set up the pre-commit hooks to reduce errors and ensure consistency

    pip install -U pre-commit
    pre-commit install

If you run into any issues, you can remove the hooks again with `pre-commit uninstall`.
